# Microsoft Outlook add-on

This add-on allows use eXo Platform collaborative tools inside Microsoft Outlook. It embeds as an add-in into Outlook for Web, Mac and Windows and offer following features:
* Save attachments from email message to a collaborative space inside the eXo portal
* Attach documents from collaborative spaces to an email message
* Convert email message to activity status, wiki page or discussion (aka forum topics) 
* Post to activity streams or create discussion from a message window
* Search in collaborative spaces directly from message window (TODO)
* Show message collaborators information and activities from the portal (TODO)

## Introduction

Outlook integration consists of two parts: add-on for eXo Platform and add-in for Microsoft Outlook.

eXo Platform add-on adds pages to intranet portal that will handle requests from Outlook application. These pages live at path /portal/intranet/outlook. There is also a web page (servlet) at path /outlook in your eXo Platform server. Both portal and servlet pages should not be used directly, only via Outlook add-in.

Outlook add-in defines user interface (aka commands and panes) in its manifest. This manifest should be used within your Office365 or instllation of Microsoft Exchange. Add-in commands implemented by pages of eXo Platform add-on.

## Usage

### Convert Message To Activity

## Installation

Install eXo Platform add-on from catalog:

    ./addon install exo-outlook
  
To install latest development version use:

    ./addon install --snapshots exo-outlook  
  
After completing the add-on installation you need to generate an Outlook [manifest](https://your.exoplatform.server/portal/rest/outlook/manifest) and install it to user Outlook account. 

![Outlook Configuration](https://raw.github.com/exo-addons/outlook/master/documentation/images/outlook_configuration.png)

Manifest can be uploaded from local file or via URL. 

Add-in manifest also can be installed in your Microsoft Exchange instance, via admin center, to organization add-ins. After that it can be enabled for all or group of users without need to install for each of them.

To keep manifest up-to-date you can point your Office365/Exchange to the add-on manifest generator [URL](https://your.exoplatform.server/portal/rest/outlook/manifest) (as shown above). But then you'll need also keep the add-in GUID the same throug several requests to the generator - how this can be possible see below in the Manifest Generator paragraph.

## Manifest Generator

Outlook add-on offers a service to generate Add-in manifests for Office365/Exchange services using your eXo Platform server host name. A new manifest can be obtained at such URL: [https://your.exoplatform.server/portal/rest/outlook/manifest](https://your.exoplatform.server/portal/rest/outlook/manifest), where you need replace "your.exoplatform.server" with actual host name of your server. The generator returns a manifest with newly generated add-in ID and all links based on the URL host name.

If it happens that your eXo Platform server will be available to Office365/Exchange under another host name, then you can point that name explicitly via `hostName` query parameter: 
`https://your.exoplatform.server/portal/rest/outlook/manifest?hostName=acme.com`

Another helpful parameter can be used `displayName`. Thansk to this you can install several eXo add-ins for Outlook into Office365/Exchange catalog.
`https://your.exoplatform.server/portal/rest/outlook/manifest?hostName=acme.com&displayName=eXo%20Platform`

Since manifest installed into Office365/Exchange service, it may be required to keep the add-in ID the same as first time it was. The generator supports use of provided GUID via `guid` query parameter: 
`https://your.exoplatform.server/portal/rest/outlook/manifest?guid=05425534-77d2-4997-9856-52a13927452e` 
You can save this URL for use between updates of the add-on, thus next time you'll request the generator it will return a manifest with given ID of your add-in.

## Configuration

Outlook Add-on doesn't need configuring something when run on publicly available server. But configration may be required when eXo Platform deployed behind proxy or/and accessible with DNS name not known to the server runtime. As you'll find in Security section, user content may be accessed by Office365/Exchange services, and for this purpose that services should know the URL of the eXo Platform server resource. 

There are two optional configuration parameters that can be specified in _exo.properties_ of eXo Platform: 
* `outlook.exo.server.host` to provide a public domain name of the eXo Platform server where Ourlook add-on runs, by default it's empy and so the add-on will determine a host name of the server from local network interfaces available in Java runtime.
* `outlook.exo.server.schema` it is _http_ by default and can be set to _https_ to force HTTPS schema for links to the user content, what is *strictly recommended* for security purpose. 

Below a sample smippet to add to your _exo.properties_ file. It tells that your server will be accessed at _myintranet.com_ domain and all links should have HTTPS schema.

```
outlook.exo.server.host=myintranet.com
outlook.exo.server.schema=https
```

Technically these parameters will be substituted into `org.exoplatform.outlook.jcr.ContentLink` component configuration of the add-on.

## Security

### Add-in pages access

Add-in consists of several pages in eXo Platform server. Main functionality provided by _/portal/intranet/outlook_ site, it handles various add-in commands for authenticated portal users. This site will be available if an user already logged in the eXo portal. 
When user not authenitcated in eXo portal, the Outlook add-in will show a login page where user will need input its username and password. Add-on offers user login persistence between requests based on portal session tokens stored on the server side with validity time configurred by _OutlookTokenService_ component (by default it's 90 days to expire add-in session). Users also can force logout in the add-in by using "Log out" button on the bottom brand bar. 

### User content access

Outlook add-in needs provide an access to user's content in eXo portal to Office365/Exchange services for attaching documents to messages. As this content will be requested directly by the office server from outside the eXo Platform server, a special short living links offered by the add-on service. These links are randomly generated and exists per-user in eXo Platform. Each such link wil be generated by the add-in when user will choose to attach his document in eXo to currently open message in Outlook. The link will be active for about a minute and can be consumed only once. In case of a failure or expiration, a new link should be requested by the add-in - it means that user has to repeat an adding attachment operation.
